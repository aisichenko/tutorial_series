# Welcome to the OCPI lab automation tutorial series


## 1. Git, Github, and code organization
- everyone initialize a repository on their computer using their own Github account
- Learn how to clone repository and make changes
- How to commit and push repository
- Branches
- Merge issues and other uh-ohs

## 2. Python and Jupyter notebooks
- Why Python
  - modular
  - open source packages
  - many packages for instrument control: [lightlab](https://github.com/lightwave-lab/lightlab) and [pymeasure](https://github.com/ralph-group/pymeasure)
- Ways to use Python
  - Pycharm or similar IDE
  - Jupyter notebooks --> the case for lab workflow and research life cycle

## 3. Lab control
- The idea of an instrument class i.e. "driver"
  - creating "instance" of an instrument and accessing its methods and settings
  - having multiple instruments, just define by the connection address
- Example of running a lab control "take data then analyze" experiment
  - in JupyterLab
- Advanced: asynchronous control
  - one-sample testing vs. systems-control
  
## Bonus round: Documentation and writing good code
- it will help you get a job (especially in a startup)
- auto-generating documentation using docstrings
- coding conventions and naming
